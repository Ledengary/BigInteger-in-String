# Implementing BigInteger class of Java using String
The second project of the "Advanced Programming" course \
In this project, By giving and input number (e.g. 2021) the code generates the number's equivalent in text (i.e. two thousand and twenty one). And by giving an input text (e.g. two thousand and twenty one) the code generates the numeric version of the text (i.e. 2021). \
One other interesting feature of the code is the ability to process decimals.
